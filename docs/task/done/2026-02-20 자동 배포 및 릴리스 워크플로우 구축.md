# 2026-02-20 Establishment of Automatic Deployment and Release Workflow

## Task Overview
As the deployment method for the frontend project transitioned to Cloudflare Pages, related workflows were organized, and `release-please` was introduced for release automation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Deployment Workflow Optimization
- **Cloudflare Pages Integration**: Transitioned from the existing self-hosted deployment method to Cloudflare Pages automatic deployment, removing the `prod-deploy` workflow.
- **Version Management**: Reset the project version to `1.0.0` and organized the release process.

### 2. Release Automation
- **Introduction of `release-please`**: Automated semantic versioning and CHANGELOG management.
- **Workflow Configuration**: Removed deprecated `package-name` input and applied latest settings when configuring the `release-please` action.

### 3. Documentation
- **Infrastructure Guide Supplement**: Reinforced documents related to frontend deployment architecture and DNS settings.
- **AI Agent Guide Improvement**: Updated collaboration guidelines.

## Verification
- Confirmed normal operation of the GitHub Actions `release-please` workflow.
- Verified Cloudflare Pages integration and deployment status.
