# Agent Work Procedure

1. Review the codebase and prepare for the task based on the `## Developer Requirements` section below.
2. If the last section is a developer's section such as `## Developer Requirement Revision` or `## Developer Review Response`, skip the middle and work from that part.
3. If there is content requiring developer decision-making, add a section called `## Agent Review Request` at the end of this file with the inquiry and terminate the task.
4. Upon task completion, add a `## Agent Work Execution Details: {yyyy-MM-dd HH:MM}` section at the end of this file and document the detailed work performed.
5. For other general work guidelines, please refer to [ai_agent_guide.md](/docs/guide/ai_agent_guide.md) before starting work.

## Developer Requirements

- Modify frontend logic to align with the backend's split login/signup process.
- **Naver Login Callback (`NaverCallback.tsx`)**:
    - If `isRegistered` is `false` after calling the login API, pop up the signup modal.
    - If `true`, immediately process login completion.
- **Signup Modal (`SignupModal.tsx`)**:
    - Receive common nickname input from the user.
    - Call the signup API upon clicking 'Sign Up'.
- **API Integration**:
    - Change response type for `loginWithNaver` (`NaverLoginResponse`).
    - Add `signupWithNaver` function.
- **UX Improvement**: Provide feedback to users via `Snackbar` (Toast messages) upon successful login and registration.

## Agent Work Execution Details: 2026-02-18 21:40

### 1. API and Type Synchronization
- Updated `src/types/api-schema.d.ts` based on backend `openapi3.json`.
- Added `signupWithNaver` function to `src/api/api.ts` and modified `loginWithNaver` to return `NaverLoginResponse`.

### 2. UI Component Implementation
- `src/components/common/SignupModal.tsx`: Implemented a dialog component for nickname input.
- `src/pages/NaverCallback.tsx`:
    - Implemented branch logic based on registration status (`isRegistered`).
    - Introduced `MUI Snackbar` to show status messages like login success, signup complete, or failure to the user.
    - Handled navigation to Home upon signup cancellation.

### 3. Verification
- Verified type safety and successful build through `npm run build`.
