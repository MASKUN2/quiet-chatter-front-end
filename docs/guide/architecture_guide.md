# Architecture Guide

This document defines the structural rules and data flow logic for the `quiet-chatter-front-end` project. It ensures that components are built consistently and dependencies are managed clearly.

## 1. Global App Layout Structure

To make sure every page looks the same, the main application wrapper is centralized in `src/App.tsx`. 

### How it looks in `App.tsx`
1. **Flex Wrapper**: A `Box` that covers the whole screen height (`minHeight: 100vh`).
2. **Main Container**: `<Container maxWidth="md" disableGutters={isMobile}>`. This ensures the content has the correct maximum width.
3. **Spacing Stack**: A layout stack containing the persistent Header, the Main Content Area (Routes), and the Footer.

### Layout Rules for New Pages
- **Keep Pages Simple**: Your new page components (in `src/pages/*`) should **never** include a `<Container>` or `<Header>`. `App.tsx` already does that for you! Just export your specific content blocks.
- **Page Content Wrapper (PagePaper)**: Always wrap the main content of your new page in the `<PagePaper>` component (`src/components/common/PagePaper.tsx`) for consistent card-like styling on desktop and mobile. Do not manually use `<Paper>` or `useMediaQuery` for page layout containers.
- **Spacing**: Use `spacing={{ xs: 2, md: 4 }}` to space out different feature blocks inside your page.
- **Responsive Padding**: The sides of the app touch the edges of the screen on mobile (`xs`), but have nice padding on desktop (`md` and up), handled automatically by the parent container.

## 2. Component Structure

### Basic Component Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Don't put too much code in one file. If a UI piece is used on multiple pages, make it a separate component in `src/components/common/`. 
- **Complex Logic**: If the logic inside a component gets too large or complex (e.g., managing pagination, forms, complex business logic), move it to a custom hook in `src/hooks/`.

### Anatomy of a Component File
This is exactly how a component file should be structured logically:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Box, Typography } from '@mui/material';
import type { SomeType } from '../../types'; // Always use auto-generated types

interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  items: SomeType[];
}

const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, items }) => {
  // 1. Hooks (State, Ref, Custom Hooks)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false);

  // 2. Event Handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    setActive(!active);
  };

  // 3. Render the UI
  return (
    <Box>
      <Typography variant="h1">{title}</Typography>
      {/* ... Add other presentation components here ... */}
    </Box>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## 3. State Management Strategy

We keep state management as simple and standard as possible:

- **Local State (`useState`)**: Top priority for UI state that is only used within a single component (like toggling a modal, tracking an input field).
- **Global Data State (`Context API`)**: Use extremely limitedly, only for information that needs to be accessed anywhere across the entire app (e.g., the `AuthContext` for user login data).
- **URL State (`useSearchParams`)**: If users need to be able to share a link that loads a specific state (like a search keyword page, or a specific page number in a list), put that state in the URL. The URL should be considered the primary source of truth for navigation variables.

## 4. API Calls and Data Logic

- **No Inline Fetching**: API call logic (using Axios or Fetch) should **never** be written directly inside components. 
- **Use the API Layer**: Import and use the helper functions explicitly defined in `src/api/api.ts`.
- **Use Custom Hooks**: Complex data fetching logic (e.g., infinite scroll, debouncing searches) should be wrapped in individual custom hooks within the `src/hooks/` folder.
- **Error Handling**: When a background network request fails, always provide appropriate feedback to the user (e.g., an Alert or Toast message). For business logic errors, usually show the message sent from the backend as it is.
