## Key Directory Descriptions

### `src/api`
Contains all functions for communicating with the backend server. Sets up the `axios` instance and exports request functions for each endpoint.

### `src/components`
Manages reusable UI elements.
- **book**: Components related to the book domain, such as book search, detail view, and Talk lists.
- **common**: Components used throughout the application, like headers, footers, and common modals.

### `src/hooks`
Custom hooks are used to separate business logic from components.
- Example: `useBookSearch.ts` handles search keyword state management, API calls, and infinite scroll logic, allowing the component to focus solely on UI rendering.

### `src/pages`
Page-level components that are targets of routing (`react-router-dom`). Primarily used to compose a screen by combining various components.

### `src/types`
- **`api-schema.d.ts`**: Automatically generated by the `npm run gen:types` command. Maps 1:1 with backend DTOs.
- **`index.ts`**: Contains refined or redefined types for easier use in the frontend.
